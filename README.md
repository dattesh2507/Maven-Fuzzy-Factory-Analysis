## Project Brief

1. Traffic source analysis

- Identifying the most useful traffic channels, campaigns, and keywords with strongest conversation rates to make financial decisions and shift budget towards most effective traffic sources.
- Analyzing user behavior and patterns in different traffic sources to enerate strategy and elevate user performance.
- •Comparing the most to least effective traffic to identify and eliminate wasteful traffic sources and scale the most effective source.

2. Website performance and analysis
- Identify the most and least viewed website pages by the customers to make creative decisions on the enhancement of the pages.
- Analyzing the conversation funnels of customers to identify the most common path customers, take before purchasing products (from landing page to sale) and lower bounce rate.
- Understanding the pattern and effect of website pages on customer orders and make changes to the website pages and push maximum products to customer orders.

3. Business patterns and analyzing seasonality
- Analyzing seasonality to better understand the pattern, spikes, or slowdowns in demand.
- Analyzing sales and revenue and identify most busy time periods to make stratigic business decisions.
- Watching product sales trend to understand the overall health of the business

**Observation:** The result shows that the company's major traffic sources are “gsearch utm_source” and “nonbrand utm_campaign”. The second highest traffic to the website is through organic and direct search without any paid campaigns.

**Observation**: Bsearch utm_source with brand utm_campaign has the most session to order conversation rate of 8.86% followed by gsearch – brand and organic/direct search. Socialbook-desktop_targeted and socialbook-pilot has the lowest. Hence it might be a good idea to decrease the budget for those campaigns and allocate it to others.

**Observation**: It seems like the product and home pages get most of the traffic among the five major pages listed. It will be a great idea to focus on enhancing these two pages for the best customer experience.

**Observation:** It seems like the original homepage still has more sessions than the custom lander page but the conversation rate from the customer selecting products to buying it is higher for the custom lander page. The custom lander page has a conversation rate of 8.68% whereas for the homepage it is 8.16%. Customers seem to be liking the new lander page and are more likely to purchase product when directed through the new lander page.

**Observation:** The session to order conversation looks great for the business as it has grown from 3.2% since starting the business in 2012 to 8.4% in the most recent quarter of 2015. Similarly, we see a drastic increase in revenue per order and revenue per session as well.

**Observation:** We see a spike in sales in the months November and December, every year for all the products and hence. The trend is most probably because of the holiday season as online retail attracts more customers. We also see high revenue in February months for the product lovebear. The product was targeted at couples for gifts. So, we see a large spike in revenue around Valentine’s Day.

**Observation:** Overall, the company seems to have increased its total revenue and margin since its start in 2012. The business seems profitable, and the increasing revenue trend seems promising.

# Suggestions

- I am  advised to invest more money in non-branded search advertisements that focus on device types with strong conversion rates. To attract more relevant traffic, examine search queries and improve keyword targeting.
- Create a marketing schedule that takes seasonal trends into account. To take advantage of increasing demand, give marketing top priority at busy times of the year and think about introducing unique specials or time-limited deals. To prevent stockouts, make sure the inventory and supply chain are ready for these times as well.
- Set aside a certain amount of the budget to experiment with fresh marketing approaches and new traffic sources. Keep a careful eye on their performance and be ready to escalate efforts that prove successful. To keep ahead of the competition in digital marketing, remain flexible and attentive to emerging trends.
- Create a procedure for continuing analysis and improvement. Examine user behavior, sales statistics, and campaign performance on a regular basis to find new areas for development. Utilize data-driven insights to guide choices and modify plans of action as necessary.

# My thoughts
This is why I want to work in data for life. This field genuinely interests me, and I love the tools that I can use with it. I think that the website data analysis is quite a different ballgame than HR or Business analyses but I still enjoyed it all the same. <br>
What I also enjoyed very much is seeing the company improve as a result of my and many others' contribution, that was very exciting for me.
